# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial.  We will only discuss three modules but there is more:

- [Queues](2-queues-md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linkedlits-md)
- [Trees](3-trees-md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
